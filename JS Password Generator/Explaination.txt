This is my web based random password generator, a project I built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript for the page layout, styling and functionality respectivley. The "range and "checkpoint" inputs on the main HTML file allow the user to choose the password length, and the inclusion of upper cae letters, numbers and symbols, using a slider and tickboxes on the UI. The functions in the JavaScript end of the app randomly chooses characters using the charCode method, which assigns each ascii to a number ranging from 0 to 255. It then appends them to an initially empty list, and returns the result as a string displayed in the password display. the getElementsById and AddEventListener methods take in information inputted by the user so that the JS code can process it.
